# Dotfiles

This is where I store my dotfiles and other personal bits of config I use for provisioning my environment.


### Installing

I've created a makefile and several scripts that takes care of installation for me.

```
git clone https://github.com/HenryCook/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles && make fresh_install
```
